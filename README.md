# Wolf Script
A C++17 embedded scripting language.

Note: This library is under heavy development and may be missing features.

## Building
A C++17 compliant compiler is required to compile this library. GCC 7, Clang 7, and VS2017 15.7 should suffice.
After you have that sorted, just include `wolfscript.hpp` and that's it!
